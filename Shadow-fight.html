              <p><b>Shadow Fight 2</b> is a role-playing fighting game developed by Nekki... The first version of the game was soft launched on October 9, 2013 while the game was later released worldwide on May 1, 2014 on both Android and iOS platforms, and on January 27, 2015, it was released on Windows 8 and 8.1. On September 13, 2018, it was released for Nintendo Switch as well. The Switch version was the first to introduce real-time versus mode to Shadow Fight 2 via local player-vs-player battles. On March 12, 2019, Nekki announced that the game has been completely rewritten with the Unity engine. The new version was made gradually available to a small number of Android users in order to avoid problems and issues, before it was finally available globally at April 7, 2019.</p>

                <p>This installment introduces the game's events with an animated prologue. In this introduction, the narrator (who is the main character) reveals that he was a legendary combatant. On his travels to find a worthy opponent, he came across and opened the Gates of Shadows, releasing the demons and effectively reducing himself to a shadow. Continuing the theme of its predecessor, players begin the game as an unarmed silhouette. They are then given simple tutorials which familiarize them with the game.</p>

                 <p>Shadow was formerly a powerful combatant, but his arrogance led him to defy the rules established by his ancestors, and he opened the Gates of Shadows. Upon doing so, he quickly realized his mistake but it was too late. The demons who were inside the Gates are freed and Shadow lost his flesh and soul and became a mere silhouette of his former self. Seeking to redeem himself, Shadow must defeat all the demons and reclaim their demon seals in order to close the Gates of Shadows and lock away the evil he has unleashed upon the world. Along his journey, Shadow meets with allies who help him in his quest, as well as many adversaries who challenge him to duels for thier own reasons.
                  Upon closing the Gates, Shadow unexpectedly gets involved in something much more sinister when one if his friends, May, got pulled in through to the Gates. Attempting to rescue May, Shadow reopens the Gates of Shadows once more and he goes through the Gates, which are revealed to be a portal and Shadow is taken to another world. He learns that all of his misfortunes are all caused by Titan, a powerful being who had conquered many worlds and is now close to invading Shadow's world. Only Shadow is the one who can stop this cruel invader once and for all.
